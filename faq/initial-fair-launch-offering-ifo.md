* Open to the public;
* No ETH allocation limit for each participant;
* 1 ETH = 333,333 BEND;

* From the moment of lock-up, holders will share the protocol income.

## Q: What can I do with the BEND token?

A: BEND holders can stake BEND to get vote-escrowed BEND (veBEND).

Your BEND will automatically be staked if you join the IFO. You will receive veBEND Token. And the longer you lock BEND, the more veBEND you will receive.

**veBEND** has two main uses: **Voting** and **Earning**.

**Voting**

Holders of veBEND can participate in voting on which NFT as collateral that Bend protocol can support for borrowing ETH and providing liquidity. It will benefit all the NFT holders as long as the supported NFT liquidity improved.

Before the mainnet launch, veBEND holders will vote for 4 of 7 bluechip NFTs that will get initial ETH lending pool support. 7 NFT collections are **Mutant Ape YC, Cool Cats, Doodles, CLONE X, Azuki, World of Women** and **CyberKongz**.

**Earning**

100% of the protocol income will be distributed to veBEND holders who stake BEND.
