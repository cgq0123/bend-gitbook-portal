# 公平启动

## 治理&#x20;

BEND 的持有者可以参与投票，决定 Bend 协议可以支持哪些 NFT 作为抵押品，借出 ETH 并提供流动性。只要支持的 NFT 的流动性得到改善，其所有的 NFT 持有者都会受益。

Before the mainnet launch, veBEND holders will vote for 4 of 7 bluechip NFTs that will get initial ETH lending pool support. 7 NFT collections are **Mutant Ape YC, Cool Cats, Doodles, CLONE X, Azuki, World of Women** and **CyberKongz**.

MAYC, Azuki, CloneX, and Doodles are now supported as collateral via Community Voting. Details: [https://snapshot.org/#/benddao.eth/proposal/QmVgsdtx6PAqKLyAMSnvXAoLrEJc1s6VVKLtWtEdqb4zPC](https://snapshot.org/#/benddao.eth/proposal/QmVgsdtx6PAqKLyAMSnvXAoLrEJc1s6VVKLtWtEdqb4zPC)

CryptoPunks and Bored Ape YC are the recognized blue chips that are supported as collaterals when Bend officially launches.&#x20;

After BEND’s fair launch, BEND holders can deposit BEND to get veBEND which stands for voting escrow BEND.&#x20;
